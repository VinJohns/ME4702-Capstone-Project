# ME4702-Capstone-Project


Arduino code for an automatic plant watering system. This code goes with the prototype we designed.\n


Features include moisture sensing and nutrient sensing with feedback sent to an Arduino, which controls how long the pumps run.
There are also adjustable settings using dials to set the level of moisture and nutrients in the soil.
